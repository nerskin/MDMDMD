## Open Datasets Challenge

We selected the Open Datasets challenge and decided to use data on traffic cameras in the ACT. The data that we used is published by the ACT government as two separate datasets:

* The [Traffic Camera Offences and Fines dataset](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-act-https%3A%2F%2Fwww.data.act.gov.au%2Fapi%2Fviews%2F2sx9-4wg7/details?q=), which gives details on violations detected by traffic cameras and the corresponding fines.
* The [Traffic Camera Locations](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=traffic+camera+locations) dataset, which provides the precise locations of cameras in the first dataset.


We have documented the metadata for the dataset at [this page](https://github.com/nerskin/collaboration_week_dream_team/blob/main/Traffic_Camera_Offences_Metadata.md)

We have collected some static visualisations at [this page](placeholder)

We have an interactive shiny app hosted at [this page](https://swanepoelmarcel.shinyapps.io/Traffic_Cam_Shiny/)

The other files in the repository are intermediate data files and code used to produce the main outputs.
