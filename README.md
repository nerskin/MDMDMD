This will be the repository that we use to address whichever collaboration week challenge we take on.

First orders of business:
1) Choose a better team name
2) Decide which [challenge](https://github.com/TNMDCollaborationWeek/Challenges) we're taking on

Test from Marcel :D
Test from Shenpeng

# Challenge 2: Open Data Challenge
There were not many strong opinions but we went with option 2
